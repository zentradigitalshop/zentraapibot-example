"""Everything read from the environment, in one place, validated once.

Two kinds of setting live in this project, and they are kept apart
deliberately — the same split ZentraShopBot itself uses, and for the same
reason.

SECRETS AND INFRASTRUCTURE live here, in .env, read once at startup: your
bot token, your Zentra API key, the database URL, the payment provider
credentials. Nothing that could drain a wallet if a browser session leaked
is ever reachable from the admin dashboard.

BUSINESS SETTINGS — your markup, which rails are on, minimum top-up — live
in the `settings` table and are read at runtime by bot/settings.py. Changing
those is what the admin dashboard is FOR. This file does not touch them.
